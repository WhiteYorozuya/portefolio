											<h2>My life</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I like computer security, the cybersécurity to be more precise. I have been very attracted to this area since I was a teenager.
                                            I have always been interested and curious about new technology since very early in my childhood. </br>
                                            Outside programming in general Im keen on everything related to digital, it can be robots, smartphones, PC, gadgets, a web site etc. </br>
                                            I love watch electronic devices  in the multimedia departments of stores but also games in video game stores.</br>
                                            I don't do too many bad things about my health, I rarely drink and I and never smoke.</br>
                                            Except that, I’m not only a geek I like to go outside, breathe the air of nature, the presence of the trees relaxes me.
                                            What I find the most interesting in plantes is that it absorbs carbon dioxide to release it into oxygen.</br>
                                            I also have an amazing experience in basketball in club,  a few years ago, I started invite a friend to do sport with him and since then,</br>
                                            I practice it very regularly with him. </br>
                                            While my baskter period, I was one of the best players and had the ability to manage my teammates, I was promoted to team captain. 
                                            What allowed me to develop a certain authority and bravery.</br>
											I love to go out with friends but I'm also a big geek in video games.
                                            I have already done some tournaments on a team games online with an English speaking community 
											because the game is in english and the players adapt to a single language so that everyone can understand each other the best posible.
